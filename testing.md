- As a player, I want:
 
    1. A game that will help sharpen my memory, so I can boost my memory performance in other areas of my life.

        - Players of memory blocks are required to memorize the colour of between 9 and 25 squares in a grid depending 
        on the level they choose to play. The player also has to remember the colours within a certain time before the 
        countdown reaches zero. Keeping track of 9 items is a challenge in itself and so this game allows the player to 
        learn and practice skills such as the [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) technique. Increasing your 
        short term memory helps in other areas of life such as remembering names and speeding up learning.

    2. A game that that has different levels of difficulty, so I can continue to challenge myself as my memory skills improve.

        - The game has three levels of difficulty, easy, medium and hard. Each jump in level significantly increases the difficulty of the game. 
        Moving from the easy level to medium level results in the amount of coloured squares that need to be remembered increasing from 9 to 16, 
        an increse in 78%. The jump to the hard level increases the cells to 25 which is a 56% increase on the medium level and motivates the player 
        to work harder on their memory skills.

    3. To be able to keep track of my high score, so I can challenge myself to beat it.

        - At the end of every game, the player's score is calculated and compared to the current highscore. If they beat the highscore a message is 
        dislpayed congratulating them on achieving a new highscore. Their highscore is displayed at the top of the game page and is stored in the 
        local storage on their device. Therefore when they return to the website at a later date their highscore is still available and 
        displayed for them.

    4. A game that I can play on all devices, so I can play it at any time or place.

        - Memory Blocks is a fully responsive website and can be played on all mobile phone devices as well as tablets, laptops and desktop computers.
 
    As a young player, I want:

    1. A game that is simple and intuitive to play, so I do not need to spend too much time learning how to play the game.

        - Memory Blocks is a very simple game to play, the goal of the game is to memorize a grid of coloured squares before a timer runs out. When 
        the timer reaches zero the coloured squares of the grid turn grey. Using their memory the player must then fill in the grid again. They simply
        choose a colour from the colour picker by clicking on it and then click on a square in the grid to fill that square with the chosen colour. The 
        game ends when the timer reaches zero. The player has the option to end the game before the timer runs out by clicking on the finish button. Messages
        are displayed a certain points during the game guiding the player on the relevant step to take such as memorizing the grid or filling in the grid.

    2. Easy controls for the game, so I can play the game comfortably and effortlessly.

        - The controls are easy to understand and implement. A series of click events are all that is required to play the game. The player simply clicks on the 
        relevant button to choose a level and clicks on the start button to play. To choose a colour they simply click on one of the coloured squares above the game grid. 
        The grid is filled in by clicking on the each square of the grid. The game is ended by clicking on the finish button or by letting the timer run down. A 
        show solution button can then be clicked to show the correct solution. They can then click the play again button to start a new game. There is no typing 
        needed during the game so the use of a keyboard is not required. 

    3. A game that is fun and exciting to play, so I can share and play with my family and friends.

        - At the end of each game the player receives a score for their effort. They can then compete with family members and friends to try and beat each others
        scores. A sense of competition brings entertaininment and it motivates players to outperform others and allows them to assess their performance against the
        performance of others. The vibrant colour scheme of the website adds energy and the countdown timer adds tension to the game as the counter approaches zero.
