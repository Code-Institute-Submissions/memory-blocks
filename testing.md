- As a player, I want:
 
    1. A game that will help sharpen my memory, so I can boost my memory performance in other areas of my life.

        - Players of memory blocks are required to memorize the colour of between 9 and 25 squares in a grid depending 
        on the level they choose to play. The player also has to remember the colours within a certain time before the 
        countdown reaches zero. Keeping track of 9 items is a challenge in itself and so this game allows the player to 
        learn and practice skills such as the [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) technique. Increasing your 
        short term memory helps in other areas of life such as remembering names and speeding up learning.

    2. A game that that has different levels of difficulty, so I can continue to challenge myself as my memory skills improve.

        - The game has three levels of difficulty, easy, medium and hard. Each jump in level significantly increases the difficulty of the game. 
        Moving from the easy level to medium level results in the amount of coloured squares that need to be remembered increasing from 9 to 16, 
        an increse in 78%. The jump to the hard level increases the cells to 25 which is a 56% increase on the medium level and motivates the player 
        to work harder on their memory skills.

    3. To be able to keep track of my high score, so I can challenge myself to beat it.

        - At the end of every game, the player's score is calculated and compared to the current highscore. If they beat the highscore a message is 
        dislpayed congratulating them on achieving a new highscore. Their highscore is displayed at the top of the game page and is stored in the 
        local storage on their device. Therefore when they return to the website at a later date their highscore is still available and 
        displayed for them.

    4. A game that I can play on all devices, so I can play it at any time or place.

        - Memory Blocks is a fully responsive website and can be played on all mobile phone devices as well as tablets, laptops and desktop computers.
