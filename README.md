- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme

    I used a "Stimulate The Brain" colour scheme for this project which I obtained from [schemecolor](https://www.schemecolor.com/stimulate-the-brain.php).
    This palette has 5 colors which are Button Blue (#29ABE9), Yellow-Green (#88C742), Cyber Yellow (#FAD500), Princeton Orange (#FC8821) and Venetian Red (#D9140C).
